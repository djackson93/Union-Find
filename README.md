# Union-Find
Program takes in an integer value 'n' input from user and creates an n x n bitmap  (and draws it on screen for visual representation). 
The program uses a 1-dimensional array of n * n length and uses arithmetic to make conversions to fit and check where an element [x][y] 
in a 2D array would be in a 1D array.
